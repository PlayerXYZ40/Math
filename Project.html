<p class="N1">
  Did you know that Systems of Linear Equations can be used for investing? You can solve how much was invested at each rate but for this, the information needed is how much invested, part at how much interest rate, the remarinder interest rate, and total interest from the 2 investments ofer a certain time period.
</p>

<p class="N2">
  <strong>Here is an example:</strong>
</p>
<p class="N1">
  Sam invested $8000, part at 9% interest rate, and the remainder at 10% interest rate. After one year his total interest from these two investments was $740. How much did he invest at each rate?
</p>
<p class="N1">
      There are multiple ways to solve this.
      You can use substitution, eliminaton, and graphing but I'll be showing you eliminaton and substitution.
</p>
<p class="N2">
    <strong>Problem solved by Substitution</strong>
</p>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
-->
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 720 – 0.09y + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 0.01y = 20
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] y = $2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x = 8000 – 2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x = $6000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  The answer is (6000, 2000)
</h6>
<p class="N2">
    <strong>Problem solved by Graphing</strong>
</p>
<img class="IMG" src="Project IMG - 1.png">
<p class="N1">
    This image shows Line B which is equation 1 and Line A which is equation 2 and as you can see, the 2 lines intercest at the point (6000,2000) which is this exact answer we would get oncce solved using either substitution or elimination and both will in the end give the same result.
</p>
<p class="N2">
  <strong>Problem solved by Elimination</strong>
</p>
<h6 class="W1">
[1] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] 0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] -10(0.09x + 0.1y = 740)
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [1] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] -0.9x - y = -7400
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [Both] 0.1x = 600
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [Both] x = 6000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  y + 0 = 2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  The answer is (6000, 2000)
